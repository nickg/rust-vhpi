# vhpi-sys

This crate provides the raw, unsafe FFI bindings for the VHDL VHPI
interface.

**Note:** You probably do not want to use this crate directly.

These are auto-generated using `bindgen` and are intended to be used by
the high-level, safe wrapper crate `vhpi`. Please see the [`vhpi` crate
documentation](https://crates.io/crates/vhpi) for a safe and ergonomic
API.
